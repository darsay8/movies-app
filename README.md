# Movies App 🎬

## This app was created using react and sass, all data is fetched from tmdb api and displays movies and its corresponding info.

The central idea was create an app where I can save my liked movies, the process is separated in these phases:

- Use the api and get movie data ( 99.9% 😉 ).
- Create unique page with overview data to each movie ( working on it...🔨 ).
- Create backend to manage users and his favs movies. ( 0 🤔 )
