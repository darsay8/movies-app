# Movies App 🎬

## This app was created using MERN stack, all data is fetched from the tmdb API and displays movies and their corresponding info.

The central idea was to create an app where I can save my liked movies, the process is separated into these phases:

- Use the API and get movie data ( 99.9% 😉 ).
- Create a unique page with overview data for each movie ( 99% 🏃🏻‍♂️ ).
- Create a backend to manage users and their favs movies. ( 99% ⚡️ )
